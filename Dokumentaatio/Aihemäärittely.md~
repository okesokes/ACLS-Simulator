**Topic:** ACLS simulator is very experimental piece of software that simulates situations where the patient is in cardiac arrest from perspective of EMS personnel.

At first, the program initializes status of patient, and the user must analyze it properly and choose and follow the correct treatment algorithms to revive the patient successfully. The program prints prognosis of patient after the situation has ended (in either the patient being revived successfully or death of patient). Prognosis contains *very rough* estimation of long term prognosis in terms of damage caused to CNS by hypoxia/anoxia. For example, the patient can be successfully revived even after long period of cardiac arrest, but the long term prognosis can still be hopeless because of fatal damage of CNS caused by lack of oxygen supply to neural cells.
