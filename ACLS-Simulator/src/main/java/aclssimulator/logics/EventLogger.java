// EventLogger logs every Event affecting the patient status (incl. events from both internal and external sources)
// and keeps track on their effects on the patient

// The class can be used for adjusting the effects of treatment, debugging and
// retrieving information for treatment efficiency monitoring purposes (eg. for debriefing)
