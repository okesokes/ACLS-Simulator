// Interface Event is implemented by every class that calculates effects in the status of patient,
// eg. upcoming classes "Treat" & "Time"/"Deteriorate"

// Event provides essential functionality for both:
// 1. transferring the calculated effects of event into patient simulation and
// 2. logging and tracing the aforementioned effects for debugging and balancing purposes
